# Code of Conduct

BIOwerk is committed to a welcoming, safe, and inclusive environment for everyone interacting with the project—whether in code, documentation, design discussions, or community spaces.

## Our Standards
**Expected behaviors**
- Show empathy, respect, and curiosity toward collaborators.
- Welcome diverse viewpoints; critique ideas, never people.
- Give and accept constructive feedback promptly.
- Default to transparency where possible and protect confidentiality when required.

**Unacceptable behaviors**
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments (verbal, written, or visual).
- Trolling, personal attacks, or sustained disruption of conversations.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission (doxing).
- Any conduct reasonably deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Reporting Channels
If you experience or witness a violation, please report it. We take all reports seriously and keep reporter identities confidential within the response team.

Primary channels (choose whichever you are most comfortable with):
- **Email:** `conduct@biowerk.example.com` for community or interpersonal concerns.
- **Security/Safety:** `security@biowerk.example.com` for threats, stalking, or safety risks.
- **Escalation hotline:** `+1-415-555-0123` (24/7 answering service routed to the incident on-call).
- **Private maintainer contact:** Direct message a maintainer in our workspace; request a synchronous conversation if email is unsafe.

When reporting, include:
- What happened, when, and where (links or screenshots welcome).
- Who was involved, if known.
- Whether the incident is ongoing and any immediate safety concerns.

## Responsibilities and Enforcement
- **Maintainers** enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith and may take corrective action for any behavior they deem inappropriate.
- **Enforcement guidelines** may include: verbal/written warnings, temporary or permanent bans from project spaces, and escalation to relevant organizations if safety is at risk.
- **No retaliation:** Retaliation against reporters or witnesses is prohibited and will be treated as a separate violation.
- **Appeals:** Requests for reconsideration can be sent to `conduct@biowerk.example.com`; a maintainer not involved in the original decision will review.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and when an individual represents the project or community in public spaces, including online forums, conferences, and social media.

## Attribution
Portions of this Code of Conduct are inspired by the Contributor Covenant v2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
