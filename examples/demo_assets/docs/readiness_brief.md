# BIOwerk Mesh Adoption Brief

## Purpose
Summarize how the BIOwerk Mesh accelerates regulated-team collaboration while keeping auditability and service reliability intact.

## Audience
- Platform engineering leadership evaluating service mesh upgrades
- Security and compliance partners validating data-handling controls
- Program managers coordinating pilot timelines

## Key Themes
- Mesh-native routing centralizes authentication, authorization, and observability for all agents.
- Document, sheet, and slide agents share the same governance envelope (versioning, audit trails, rate limits).
- Demo payloads are fully sanitized—no customer names, secrets, or credentials.

## Outline
1. Context and goals for the next quarter
2. Reliability posture (health probes, bulkheads, backpressure)
3. Data governance (audit logging, redaction, export review)
4. Demo flow and expected artifacts for leadership reviews
5. Next steps with owners and checkpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- Executives see a cohesive story that blends metrics, visuals, and narrative.
- Data reviewers can trace every generated artifact back to sanitized inputs.
- Operators can replay the flows in lower environments without external dependencies.
